# Role Context and Product Involvement  
As an **AI Engineer** on the Personalization & Recommendation team you will:  
- Build & deploy ML models that power “Recommended for you” feeds, search‐result rankings & tailored offers.  
- Collaborate with Data Engineering (Kafka/Spark), Backend Services (Docker, Kubernetes on AWS), Product Management & UX to integrate models into Booking.com’s global platform.  
- Maintain CI/CD pipelines for model training, evaluation & production deployment; monitor model performance (latency, accuracy, business metrics such as CTR & conversion uplift).  
- Optimize distributed training (TensorFlow/PyTorch) for large-scale data (10⁹+ events/day), ensure reproducibility & robust A/B testing infrastructure.  

# Likely Interview Topics  
**1. Machine Learning & Algorithms**  
- Recommendation algorithms: collaborative filtering, embeddings, hybrid models  
- Personalization techniques: context-aware ranking, multi-armed bandits  
- Model evaluation: offline metrics (RMSE, precision@k), online metrics (CTR, lift)  

**2. Software & System Design**  
- Designing scalable data pipelines (e.g., Kafka, Spark/Flink)  
- Microservices for model serving (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS/EKS)  
- CI/CD for ML (Terraform, Jenkins/GitHub Actions, MLflow)  

**3. Model Deployment & Monitoring**  
- Containerization and orchestration (Dockerfile optimizations, Helm charts)  
- Monitoring & alerting (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog)  
- Rollback strategies, canary deployments, drift detection  

**4. Coding & Technical Deep Dives**  
- Python proficiency: idiomatic code, libraries (NumPy, pandas)  
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: custom layers, training loops, performance tuning  
- AWS services: S3, Lambda, SageMaker or custom EC2/EKS pipelines  

**5. Behavioral & Culture Fit**  
- Ownership stories: end-to-end projects, cross-team collaboration  
- Customer-centric mindset: improving user experience via personalization  
- Examples of learning from failure & doing the right thing  

# Suggested Questions to Ask  
1. **Team & Roadmap**  
   - “Can you describe the structure of the Personalization & Recommendation organization? How do AI Engineers, Data Engineers and Product Managers collaborate?”  
   - “What are the team’s top priorities in the next 6–12 months?”  

2. **Data & Infrastructure**  
   - “What does your current ML infrastructure look like (compute, data stores, orchestration)? Any major planned upgrades?”  
   - “How is data quality and labeling handled for training and online inference?”  

3. **Model Performance & Metrics**  
   - “Which key business metrics (e.g., CTR, conversion uplift) do you track for personalization experiments?”  
   - “How do you balance exploration vs. exploitation in your recommendation algorithms?”  

4. **Culture & Growth**  
   - “How does Booking.com support continuous learning, e.g., conferences, internal knowledge-shares or dedicated learning time?”  
   - “What are typical career paths for AI Engineers within the organization?”  

5. **Commitment & Values**  
   - “How does the team embed Booking.com’s values (Think customer first, Learn forever, Own it) in day-to-day work?”  
   - “Could you share an example of how the team ‘did the right thing’ when faced with a tough technical or ethical decision?”
